# Testing

Over the decades of people doing software development
one truth has been found:
Untested software rarely works.
(Many people would go so far and add
"Most tested software doesn't work either."
But we are all optimists here, right?)
So, to ensure that your program does what you expect it to do,
it is wise to test it.

One easy way to do that is
to write a `README` file
that describes what your program should do.
And when you feel ready to make a new release,
go through the `README` and ensure that
the behavior is still as expected.
You can make this a more rigorous exercise
by also writing down how your program should react to erroneous inputs.

Here's another fancy idea:
Write that `README` before you write the code.
