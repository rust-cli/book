# Output

## Printing "Hello World"

```rust
println!("Hello World");
```

Well, that was easy.
Great! Onto the next topic.

## Using `println!`

You can pretty much print all the things you like
with the `println!` macro.
This macro has some pretty amazing capabilities,
but also a special syntax.
It expects a string literal that contains placeholders
as the first parameter. The string will be filled in
by the values of the parameters that follow as further arguments.

For example:

```rust
let x = 42;
println!("My lucky number is {}.", x);
```

will print:

```console
My lucky number is 42.
```

The curly braces (`{}`) in the string above is one of these placeholders.
This is the default placeholder type
that tries to print the given value in a human readable way.
For numbers and strings, this works very well,
but not all types can do that.
This is why there is also a "debug representation"
that you can get by filling the braces of the placeholder like this: `{:?}`.

For example:

```rust
let xs = vec![1, 2, 3];
println!("The list is: {:?}", xs);
```

will print:

```console
The list is: [1, 2, 3]
```

If you want your own data types to be printable for debugging and logging,
you can typically add a `#[derive(Debug)]` above their definition.

**Note:**
"User-friendly" printing is done using the [`Display`] trait and
debug output (human-readable but targeted at developers) uses the [`Debug`] trait.
You can find more information about the syntax you can use in `println!`
in the [documentation for the `std::fmt` module][std::fmt].

## Printing errors

Printing errors should be done via `stderr`
to make it easier for users
and other tools
to pipe their outputs to files
or more tools.

<aside>

**Note:**
On most operating systems,
a program can write to two output streams: `stdout` and `stderr`.
`stdout` is for the program's actual output
while `stderr` allows errors and other messages to be kept separate from `stdout`.
That way,
output can be stored to a file or piped to another program
while errors are shown to the user.

</aside>

In Rust, this is achieved
with `println!` and `eprintln!`,
the former printing to `stdout`
and the latter to `stderr`.

```rust
println!("This is information");
eprintln!("This is an error! :(");
```

<aside>

**Beware**: Printing [escape codes] can be dangerous and
put the user's terminal into a weird state.
Always be careful when manually printing them!

[escape codes]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code

Ideally, you should be using a crate like `ansi_term`
when dealing with raw escape codes
to make your (and your user's) life easier.

## A note on printing performance

Printing to the terminal is surprisingly slow!
If you call things like `println!` in a loop,
it can easily become a bottleneck in an otherwise fast program.
To speed this up,
there are two things you can do.

First,
you might want to reduce the number of writes
that actually "flush" to the terminal.
`println!` tells the system to flush to the terminal _every_ time
because it is common to print each new line.
If you don't need that,
you can wrap your `stdout` handle in a [`BufWriter`],
which buffers up to 8Â kB by default.
You can still call `.flush()` on this `BufWriter`
when you want to print immediately.

```rust
use std::io::{self, Write};

let stdout = io::stdout(); // get the global stdout entity
let mut handle = io::BufWriter::new(stdout); // optional: wrap that handle in a buffer
writeln!(handle, "foo: {}", 42); // add `?` if you care about errors here
```

Second,
it helps to acquire a lock on `stdout` (or `stderr`)
and use `writeln!` to print to it directly.
This prevents the system from locking and unlocking `stdout` over and over again.

```rust
use std::io::{self, Write};

let stdout = io::stdout(); // get the global stdout entity
let mut handle = stdout.lock(); // acquire a lock on it
writeln!(handle, "foo: {}", 42); // add `?` if you care about errors here
```

You can also combine the two approaches.

[`BufWriter`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.39.0/std/io/struct.BufWriter.html

## Showing a progress bar

Some CLI applications run less than a second while
others take minutes or hours.
If you are writing one of the latter types of programs,
you might want to show the user that something is happening.
For this, you should try to print useful status updates,
ideally in a form that can be easily consumed.

Using the [indicatif] crate,
you can add progress bars
and little spinners to your program.
Here's a quick example:

```rust,ignore
{{#include output-progressbar.rs:1:9}}
```

See the [documentation][indicatif docs]
and [examples][indicatif examples]
for more information.

## Logging

To make it easier to understand what is happening in our program,
we might want to add some log statements.
This is usually easy while writing your application,
and it will become super helpful when running this program again in half a year.
In some ways,
logging is the same as using `println!`
except that you can specify the importance of a message.
The levels you can usually use are _error_, _warn_, _info_, _debug_, and _trace_
(_error_ has the highest priority, _trace_ the lowest).

To add simple logging to your application,
you'll need two things:
The [log] crate (this contains macros named after the log level)
and an _adapter_ that actually writes the log output somewhere useful.
Having the ability to use log adapters is very flexible:
You can, for example, use them to write logs not only to the terminal
but also to [syslog] or to a central log server.

[syslog]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog

Since we are only concerned with writing a CLI application,
an easy adapter to use is [env_logger].
It's called "env" logger because you can
use an environment variable to specify which parts of your application
you want to log
and at which level you want to log them.
It will prefix your log messages with a timestamp
and the module where the log messages come from.
Since libraries can also use `log`,
you easily configure their log output, too.

[log]: https://crates.io/crates/log
[env_logger]: https://crates.io/crates/env_logger

Here's a quick example:

```rust,ignore
{{#include output-log.rs}}
```

Assuming you have this file as `src/bin/output-log.rs`,
on Linux and macOS, you can run it like this:
```console
$ env RUST_LOG=info cargo run --bin output-log
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.17s
     Running `target/debug/output-log`
[2018-11-30T20:25:52Z INFO  output_log] starting up
[2018-11-30T20:25:52Z WARN  output_log] oops, nothing implemented!
```

In Windows PowerShell, you can run it like this:
```console
$ $env:RUST_LOG="info"
$ cargo run --bin output-log
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.17s
     Running `target/debug/output-log.exe`
[2018-11-30T20:25:52Z INFO  output_log] starting up
[2018-11-30T20:25:52Z WARN  output_log] oops, nothing implemented!
```

In Windows CMD, you can run it like this:
```console
$ set RUST_LOG=info
$ cargo run --bin output-log
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.17s
     Running `target/debug/output-log.exe`
[2018-11-30T20:25:52Z INFO  output_log] starting up
[2018-11-30T20:25:52Z WARN  output_log] oops, nothing implemented!
```

`RUST_LOG` is the name of the environment variable
you can use to set your log settings.
`env_logger` also contains a builder
so you can programmatically adjust these settings
like showing _info_ level messages by default.

There are a lot of alternative logging adapters out there
as well as alternatives and extensions to `log`.
If you know your application will have a lot to log,
make sure to review them
and make your users' lives easier.

**Tip:**
Experience has shown that even mildly useful CLI programs can end up being used for years to come,
especially if they were meant as a temporary solution.
If your application doesn't work
and someone (e.g., you, in the future) needs to figure out why,
being able to pass `--verbose` to get additional log output
can make the difference between minutes and hours of debugging.
The [clap-verbosity-flag] crate contains a quick way
to add a `--verbose` to a project using `clap`.
